# Dots
Dots - An extensible particle toy program.

## What is Dots
Dots is an extensible particle toy (can be extended via plugins using PhysicsCore). I wrote it for fun a couple of years ago to test GDI+ painting and whatnot. It's fun to mess around with and reverse, so feel free to tinker and maybe make something cool!
